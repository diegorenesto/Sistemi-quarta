Binary Number System

Binary is a numbering system that consists of the numbers 0 and 1 called bits. In contrast, the decimal numbering system consists of 10 digits consisting of the numbers 0 - 9. Binary is important for us to understand because hosts, servers, and network devices use binary addressing, specifically, binary IPv4 addresses, to identify each other. You must know binary addressing and how to convert between binary and dotted decimal IPv4 addresses. This topic presented a few ways to convert decimal to binary and binary to decimal.

Hexadecimal Number System

Just as decimal is a base ten number system, hexadecimal is a base sixteen system. The base sixteen number system uses the numbers 0 to 9 and the letters A to F. The hexadecimal numbering system is used in networking to represent IPv6 addresses and Ethernet MAC addresses. IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and every 4 bits is represented by a single hexadecimal digit; for a total of 32 hexadecimal values. To convert hexadecimal to decimal, you must first convert the hexadecimal to binary, then convert the binary to decimal. To convert decimal to hexadecimal, you must also first convert the decimal to binary.
